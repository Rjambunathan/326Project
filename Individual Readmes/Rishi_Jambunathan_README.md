Project Description: Facial recognition web-app for people with Alzheimers. You can upload a photo of a person with their name. That information would be saved to the database. The website would use facial recognition to identify the name of the person by pointing the camera at the person. You can also store additional information about the person like their relationhip to you, address and other related information. People with Alzheimers forget the people they know, so this will tool will let them know who the people around them are.
